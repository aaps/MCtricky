A project that will make a standardised minecraft naming and coloring sceme

also alpha, textures , models, and usv for blender import, all this soon

You can user materials.json , be ware this is nog json but python repr

if you want your own materials change staticvalues.py and run getcolors to fill in the colors and the names via web connect. (or you make your own names and colors via the staticvalues)

After that you have a new materials.json
